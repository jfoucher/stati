# Stati

A static site generator in PHP that can work with any existing jekyll site and get the same results.

That is the end goal anyway.

### Status

It can generate a _site folder with posts (found in the _posts directory) with the permalink structure defined in _config.yml

Nothing else for the time being

### Why that name ?

Because `static` turns out to be a reserved word in PHP. Who would've thought ?
